              <h2>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h2>
              <p>Lets take the example of building a house to describe HTML and CSS. HTML represents the building blocks for the house. The stone foundation, the timber for the framing and the pipes that run underground for the plumbing and water. CSS represents our styling or decoration. This could be the paint for the walls, carpet for the floor or the types of curtains we put in. CSS by itself is just a bunch of random stuff that doesnt do anything. But when attached to the framework it creates the full picture.</p>

              <h2>Explain Control Flow and Loops</h2>
              <p>Control Flow is in programming is the order that commands run in or the organisation of nested elements. Say for example we need to power a laptop charger while we are camping. There is no power outlets around so we need to provide power in the form of a generator. We turn the generator on which creates power for our extension lead. We plug our charger into the extension lead and then the laptop charges. It's similar for programming where we want a function to do something. We need to make the function (the generator), write the necessary code inside of the function (plugging in the cords) and then call the function (turning the power on).</p>
            <br>
              <p>Loops are a tricky concept in programming that I will attempt to explain here. Loops are like creating a simple machine to execute a simple task multiple times and then stops when it is done. We give the machine a set of parameters eg. 'Cook eggs untill everyone in the house has eggs'. We tell the machine there is 5 people in the house and the machine cooks 5 eggs untill all 5 people in the house have eggs. The machine then stops cooking eggs when the task is complete.</p>    
              <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h2>
              <p>The DOM or Document Object Model is a tool developers can use to see the control flow and individual elements on a web browser. The DOM stores all of the code on a website and can be used to find individual classes of code or ID's assigned to the code lines very easily. We can use the DOM inside our code editor to access the webpage using document. keywords and then manipulate classes or ID's with Javascript syntax.</p>
              <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
              <p>Objects and arrays are two ways we can store data in Javascript. Objects use things called 'variables' that we can define in our JS code. We access the variable by using 'methods' at the end of the variable. Arrays are like little containers that we can store information in and are written with square brackets []. We can use arrays to store all kinds of useful information. Arrays are useful when using the DOM as mentioned above as we can see all the information inside arrays and then pluck out the things we need.</p>
              <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h2>
              <p>Functions are blocks of code that we can use to run multiple commands at once by only having to call the function name. Functions can contain all of the above things we mentioned like arrays, variables, loops and DOM manipulation code. Functions are great if we know we have code that will change in the future, for example adding food items to a menu. We can make functions to include new things we add into our code. If we didn't use functions properly we would have to 'hard code' things in outside of certain function rules which gets messy and makes bug fixing very difficult. By creating a range of well constructed functions, our code looks much nicer, is easier to bug fix, and has more utility options for expansion.</p>
