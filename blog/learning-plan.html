            <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>My long term goal for doing Dev Academy was to find a new career that I can get passionate about again. I was so burnt out on my old career from years of grinding that it just became a chore and I started to hate everything about it. I love to find an industry that aligns with my interests and has job security for this unknown world that we live in. A bit more money than my last career path would also be nice too.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning.</h2>
            <p> I can be extremely motivated when I am interested in upskilling something. I really put alot of time into research and trying to understand more and more how to get better at that topic. I do have trouble with getting up in the morning sometimes, which is still a by product of my old life but I get there eventually. I do struggle with doing tutorial videos/lessons if I have to do alot of them back to back to back but if I just pace myself with it and take breaks it generally works out ok.</p>    
            <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
            <p>I would love to get to know more people on a personal level. I'm an introvert by nature and can easily spend alot (possibly too much) time on my own and not get bored or lonely. I would really like to develop some deeper friendships with new people while I'm at Dev Academy, not just for the business contacts side, but to share my experiences with and listen to theirs also.</p>
            <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
            <p>I will commit to managing my workload by always trying my hardest, showing up on time, and being the best and smartest person I can be for the good of the working community and my own code of honor. I will commit to being consciencious of others personal space and skill levels. I will commit to always giving my best effort in the time frames given. I will commit to being patient around others and to give my best attempts at not getting stressed out so that I can be a cool, chill anchor for my team mates if they need.</p>
            <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
            <p>I will commit to trying my hardest to understand a problem by myself first. When I can't get what I need I will try google. If that fails I will turn to my colleagues and then the facilitators after that. I will commit to not being afraid to ask for help if I am struggling.</p>
            <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h2>
            <p>I would expect them to be chill, relaxed and helpful when we need. I would love to have a coffee with them or hang out casually and just ask questions.</p>
