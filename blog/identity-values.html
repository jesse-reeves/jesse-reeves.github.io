              <h2>Who do I admire?</h2>
              <p>This is an interesting question as I have never felt like a person that has rolemodels. I never had any rolemodels growing up and would always struggle to answer when people asked me who my rolemodels were. I guess I am big fans of certain streamers but I dont know if I would consider them to be role models. Unfortunately every time I got close enough to someone who I thought could be a role model they always tended to shit on me so much untill I backed off. Those people probably weren’t the best role models... I’ve always been a very individualistic person and have carved my own path against a lot of the advices I got from family members, for better or worse. The decisions I’ve made in my life have got me to where I am now however which I can never regret. I’m finally happy and not depressed any more which is a statement that I didn’t know I’d ever be able to say.</p>
              <br>
              <h2>What inspires me to take action?</h2>
              <p> I have never had a problem speaking my mind. I was a fairly docile teenager and just went with the flow. No thoughts, head empty vibes. I do remember a specific moment where I felt like my brain had developed enough for me to use it solve a problem and I remember my boss at the time was absolutely shocked when I solved this problem on my own by using my own mind. I guess that could be a sign of my mental maturity finally kicking in. I also had the wisdom to identify that I had solved a problem by using my own mind. In school I was also a mostly no thoughts, head empty student as well. Unfortunately I didn’t care enough about the education that I had to really try and do well. I scraped through year 12 somehow but absolutely shit the bed when it came to year 13. There was just no motivation.
                I also remember another moment during one of my first jobs where I was working and one of my ‘superiors’ came up to me talking shit about something. Giving me a bunch of shit jobs to do because they didn’t like me for whatever reason. That was one of the first moments I remember really standing up to someone because of injustice. They were so shocked that I stood up for myself that they instantly backed off and were bashful and shamed. They apologized to me later and had more respect for me after that. I learned that day that you should never be afraid to stand up to injustice even in small situations like someone giving you shit at work. There have been countless examples after that about situations where I’ve stood up to people for different things and they all have the same reaction because they know that they are in the wrong most of the time.</p>    
              <h2>When do you feel wrong in some way?</h2>
              <p>I do have tendencies to feel alone sometimes particularly if I’m in a social situation and I don’t get along with people as well as I feel that I should. It’s an interesting topic because I’m the kind of person who can spend days/weeks at home by myself and not feel alone or like i’m missing out on anything. I do remember how I felt when I made the horrific decision to try and go back to my childhood church in my adult years to try and do good there and serve the community. The feelings of loneliness that I experienced there were unlike anything I’ve felt before. In a community of people that preach about getting out into the community and making connections I felt more alone then I ever had in my life. The faces they put on when they were being nice to you were all a sham. They didn’t care about me. They only cared about themselves. They judged me and looked at me like a sinner when they should’ve been looking inward at their own behaviour. I’ve never been in a social environment so hostile to new comers if you weren’t their ideal personality type. They were all so shocked when I left as well. I hope they feel shame. I hope they think of their actions. I hope they learn from what happened to me. But they probably wont. Inward looking, selfish people rarely self reflect on the pain they cause others.</p>
              <h2>When do you feel real/authentic?</h2>
              <p>I cant look past my friends and family. When I am around my best friends and family I am my best self. I don’t have to try. I don’t have to think. I’m the perfect combination of no thoughts, head empty but also relaxed and on to it. We don’t even do anything special. Just talk about interests, swim in the pool, eat amazing food. It’s all just so easy.</p>
              <h2>Some values I care about.</h2>
              <p>Family, Creativity, Wisdom, Honesty, Self-Respect, Patience</p>
              <h2>How my culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
              <p>I grew up in a middle/lower class household that was not wealthy but we also werent stuggling to put food on the table. I (as i’ve put earlier) was a very no thoughts, head empty child/teenager and had no real sense of identity untill I got to my late teens. I had an abusive father who put me and my sister through hell with mental abuse using religion as the catalyst. We would constantly get hounded that we were sinning and that the things we were doing were going to send us to hell when we died. Growing up in church and attending the church private school we were all to aware of hell and that if we sinned we were going there. This level of abuse took its toll for quite sometime untill I was around 17 years old. I remember a specific instance where I became really interested in music and loved bands like Metallica, Lamb of God and other various metal bands. I knew suddenly that music was what I wanted to do with my life. My father being a tradie and only having tradie mates said no boy you’re not doing that stupid evil music you have to become a sparkie or a painter. I remember finally deciding that I had enough with that trash and said that I was going to be a musician. This didn’t go down well and my father used every trick in his manipulative book to get me away from the ‘evil’ music. He burned my clothes, deleted music from my computer, yelled, screamed and blasphemed his way to get me to stop. This fueled me even further. I remember a night where I had downloaded Slipknot onto my iPod. Slipknot at the time were openly anti-christian and they wore masks and had songs called The Heritics Anthem which the chorus says, “If I’m 555 then your 666”. Very anti-christian, ‘evil’ music. I lay in my bed at night, around 17 years of age and said to myself, “I’m going to listen to what demons sound like.” Slipknot to this day are one of my favourite bands of all time.
                I learned that night to question things all the time. If you dont believe what someone is spouting at you then try and disprove it. Live your own beliefs and stand up for them. </p>
                <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h2>
                <p>I’m the kind of persons that can be super motivated when learning new things. I go hard early and try my best. I can also be the kind of person to procrastinate alot if the work is difficult or I get sidetracked by things around me. My first year of music study I was top of my class and finished with extremely high marks because I tried super hard and made the most of my time. I let myself get sidetracked in my second year and my performance fell dramatically. Because my grades fell I also fell into some deep depression due to things happening in my life. I struggled my way through eventually but it took a major toll on my mental state and I barely achieved anything for the next two years. The key for me is to stay motivated and dont let distractions get in the way. I also can be prone to burnout as I’ve experienced that for so so many years with my music. Just continually grinding away all the time day after day on something that has a 0.01% chance to succeed. I’ll tell you though, I almost got there. But that effort that it took completely drained my motivation for pretty much everything except work and gaming. I finally feel refreshed after all of that pain and my motivation is through the roof at the moment. I’m confident that I can keep this train of motivation strong and that I go strongly from one topic to the next.</p>
                <h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was a resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now.</h2>
                <p>I have alot of experience working in bands with multiple people (even up to over 100 people) where there was ALOT of resistance coming in from the different band members. I was usually the most experienced as well which meant I had the title of Music Director. I would get constant resistance from people with almost every little decision or critique that I had to give. Working in bands is also a very emotional environment as no musician ever wants to have their work critiqued as they believe that what they are doing is flawless and perfect. My main strategy that I found worked was always listening to people and giving them a chance to put their opinion/thoughts into the discussion even if that person may not have been the most experienced in the group. Acknowledging everyone and giving everyone a chance to speak improved group relations and lead to some unexpected outcomes, mostly positive but its life, not everything always goes well.
                    If i was going to try new strategies I would mostly just try and hone into the above strategy even more and listen even more. Ultimately it was my choice what happened but having all the information possible to go off really improved the results that impacted the final decisions that I made.</p>
