              <p>
                  As a gamer I love puzzles and I love working out solutions to puzzles so going through the JS Kata and other exersices during Dev Academy has been one big problem solving field day. I've had to stretch every fibre of my brain to be able to keep up with this work and make sure my answers are good enough and have enough explanation in them to satisfy the learning competencies and my own code of quality.
            </p>
            <br>
              <p>I got blocked many times while doing the JS Kata exercises and have had to pull every google trick that I know from my book. One of the hardest steps for me is figuring out where to start. If I can get the ball rolling on a question (sometimes it's more a boulder than a ball) then I can generally stumble my way through. I was doing a question from one of the JS Kata sections and was pulling my hair out over the answer. I researched and researched what I was doing wrong and how to solve the question but eventually turned to my cohort buddies for clarity. Turns out the answer was extremely simple and I had spent far too long and made the question so much harder for myself then I needed to. I had to laugh over this at the lengths I went to to solve such a simple question.</p> 
            <br>   
              <p>Elegant problem solving for me comes when I figure out the right wording and extract the information that I need from google and when I put the answer in it comes out correct. Google has been absolutely ESSENTIAL for going through this material and I'm so happy that other people have struggled with answers before I did so that I can learn from their mistakes. Maybe one day people can learn from the mistakes that I make and the questions I ask as well.</p>

              <p>
                Pseudocode I find useful just to blurt out my train of thought and reflect back upon when I get stuck on the next step of the question. My problem with pseudocode is sometimes I don't even know what it is that I need to write out in simple terms and that's when I get stuck. I will then spend an hour googling different things to try help me understand what it is that I need to understand.

                I will try stuff if I think I know what the answer will be but generally I am wrong 99% of the time. In the rare case that I try something and it works I jump for joy because my fluke answer turned out to be right. Trying things is beneficial though as you can cross one thing off the list that didn't work and then go for something new.

                I read up on the rubber ducky method but was yet to try that technique as I was probably too prideful to resort to talking to an inanimate object. I can see the value to it though, the problem for me is that I don't even know what I'm trying to say or explain most of the time.

                One thing that does help me alot is reading error messages. I've found them to be very useful when something I'm trying to return doesn't work. Usually it points out to me that I've spelt something wrong or put in one to many curly bracers or one not enough. Top marks for the error messages generally telling me what I've done wrong and giving me an idea on how to fix it.

                I find console. logging tricky as once again I generally don't know what I'm trying to fix or solve. I have yet to unlock it's full potential but I need to try experimenting with it more. I guess I'm scared that it will return syntax errors due to the console log and I won't know where to go from there. This is definitly a technique that I need to utulise more often in my problem solving.

                Dr. Google. I can't say enough about how useful google has been for me. This has been my go to problem solving technique for almost everything I'm stuck on. I use google within seconds for almost every answer as the blogs and forums people post on are super useful for any information. I would say learning programming would almost be impossible without google unless you had some MASSIVE books that had everything inside them but even then you are zooming through tables of contents and wasting alot of time. Google you can type in exactly what you are looking for and it pretty much always provides what you need.

                If google fails me (which it occassionally does) I ask my cohort members for help. My cohort members are somehow SUPER knowledgeable on programming even though they are working through the same curricullum as I am. Anytime I ask a question in Slack my super helpful cohort members can provide me with steps to figuring out my problems. They go the extra mile for you as well offering zoom meetings and calls just to help you understand better. Love my cohort buddies.

                I've felt like I havn't wanted to bother my facilitators with technical questions too much as I understand they are super busy with day to day activities keeping Dev Academy moving. The times I have asked my facilitators questions they have given really great and useful answers but again I respect their time and don't want to bother them too much when I can ask my cohort members instead.

                Reflection is great for me as it allows me to get my thoughts down onto the screen and let me actually think about my answers and how I've accomplished things. I really enjoy the reflection process and find it does help me alot.
