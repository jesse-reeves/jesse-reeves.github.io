              <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
              <p>I would say that I have no such ego when it comes to learning programming. If anything I've become less confident the further I progressed through the material. I've learnt that everyone learns differently. I've learnt that I'm not the kind of person who can just bang their head against a wall for hours trying to work out solutions on my own. I respond far better when I have resources to reference or a video to watch to help me.</p>
              <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
              <p>
                They will keep me on track I hope. I feel like I'm the kind of person who can start to slack off if I don't get something or get stuck on an answer multiple times. Keeping hold of my personal values of doing my best will help me alot when I feel like I am getting to that stage.</p>    
              <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
              <p>How hard it got so quickly and how slow my brain seems to be at picking up the new skills. I did not expect to be stuck on literally every question so quickly. I will be honest and say that I'm slightly worried that I won't be able to keep up during bootcamp so we will see how that goes.</p>
              <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
              <p>Putting everything together. We learn about functions, variables, loops, arrays etc but when it came time for me to apply that knowledge and use it all harmoniously I fell flat. I understand how the things work individually but when it comes to combining them into actually working code I constantly feel lost.</p>
              <h2>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
              <p>Because it's easy to give up and lose interest. It's a very challenging subject we are learning in such a short time frame it can be easy to be overwhelmed and think you can't do it. Putting down your values on paper and identifying your core strengths will help keen you focussed when the going gets really tough.</p>
              <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
              <p>It feels useful. As I said before I feel like this stuff is so difficult in a short amount of time. Defining what your core beliefs and strengths are will allow us to call upon those things when we really need that emotional boost.</p>
