              <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
              <p>Neuroplasticity is the concept that brains are not a fixed thing but instead a malleable and adaptive organ. This is very beneficial as it means everyones brains are constantly shifting and evolving instead of being static and fixed as was thought from the original studies of the brain. This means we are not limited to what we can learn and are not capable of learning, we can learn and do anything regardless of being 'talented' in that particular subject.</p>
              <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit.</h2>
              <p>Neuroplasticity is excellent when it comes to learning programming. Programming is a fairly new skill compared to things like maths or music. A child born might appear to be talented in maths or music but them being talented in programming would be rare compared to the former subjects. Neuroplasticity can help people that might be older and wanting to pick up new skills like programming. I never considered myself to be very academically strong as I didn't do very good at school but I believe that was due to the education system that I had growing up. Neuroplasticity gives people like me hope as it means if I apply myself and believe that I CAN do it then I can and my brain will evolve and mold to the new information that I'm giving it.</p>    
              <h2>What are some ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
              <p>Practicing all the time. We need to strengthen the neuron pathways in our brains into well formed highways. If you walk in untreaded grass multiple times everyday it will eventually start to look like a path. This is the same with our brains we just need to keep walking and practicing those new skills. Another way is to think about the skills even when we aren't physically practicing them. Thinking about solving a problem even when we are not physically doing it engages the same neurons in our brain as when we are actually physically doing them. Constantly engaging our neurons for the new skills will help strengthen our neuroplasticity.</p>

              <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
              <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
              <p>Neuroplasticity is the concept that brains are not a fixed thing but instead a malleable and adaptive organ. This is very beneficial as it means everyones brains are constantly shifting and evolving instead of being static and fixed as was thought from the original studies of the brain.

            <br>
              <h2>Discuss what it is and how it is relevant.</h2>
              <p>Growth mindset is relevant for programming as it is a fairly new skill and it will take the belief in ourselves that we can learn this instead of a fixed mindset. Fixed mindset is the belief that the brain is wired at birth and the skills and talents that you have are the ones you have and you can't be good at other things.</p>    
              <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
              <p>For me this exploration is refreshing as I wasn't the most educationally adept person growing up and the schooling I had made me believe that I wasn't very intelligent or smart because I didn't click with the material that we had. I love the idea of a growth mindset because it rewires me to believe that I actually am intelligent and am capable of learning these difficult concepts that we have to grasp.</p>
              <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
              <p>I will integrate growth mindset when the going gets tough and the concepts seem very challenging I need to remember that I can do the work and I am capable. My brain is capable of learning and adapting to new concepts over time I just need to not fall into the fixed mindset trap that I can't do things or I'm not smart enough. I am smart enough and my brain will adapt and learn if I keep practicing and give it enough time.</p>
